## Fellowship Experience

### Mountaintop RIVET Fellowship
- **Type:** Mountaintop RIVET Fellowship  
- **Fellowship Location:** New York City  
- **Project Type:** Education  
- **Inspiration:**  
  > "I am inspired by the opportunity to be part of a global community of changemakers and to receive mentorship that will enable me to transform ideas into impactful initiatives. Mountaintop aligns with my vision to create sustainable solutions to pressing social challenges, combining innovation, leadership, and collaboration."  
- **Overview:**  
  During my fellowship, I am developing a **Community Impact Dashboard for NYC**â€”an innovative platform designed to visualize and address social challenges such as poverty, food insecurity, and access to education. This project leverages NYC Open Data and incorporates a forecasting time series model to predict trends in key social indicators over time. The forecasting techniques used include:
  - **Deep Learning:** LSTM and GRU models to capture sequential patterns.
  - **Statistical Models:** ARIMA for trend analysis, Prophet for time series decomposition, and GARCH for volatility prediction.
  - **Machine Learning:** XGBoost for regression with lagged features.
  - **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions using meta-model stacking for more robust forecasts.
  
  This multifaceted approach will empower nonprofits, policymakers, and community members with actionable insights to drive positive change.
